# Synthetic network generation
Script ``scripts/multipathway_net.py`` generates the networks. The usage of this script is provided in ``scripts/master_usage.sh``. For help, do the following:
```
python multipathway_net.py -h
```
Script ``scripts/master_experiments.sh`` was used to generate all the synthetic networks used in the paper.

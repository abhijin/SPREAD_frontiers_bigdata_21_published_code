clusters

## Synthetic network generation
Folder: ``./synthetic_networks``
See README.md in this folder for information.

## Multi-pathway simulations
Folder: ``./simulator``
See README.md in this folder for information.

## Structural and dynamical analysis
Folder: ``./analysis``
See README.md in this folder for information.

## Results
The results of network measurements and simulations are in ``results.db``. It has two tables.

* ``mpsn_props`` has network measures for all the generated synthetic networks.
* ``summary`` has simulation results.

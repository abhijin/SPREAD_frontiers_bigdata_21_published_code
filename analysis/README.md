# Structural and dynamical analysis of multi-pathway networks
All code is in ``./scripts/``.

* ``master_experiments.sh`` generates structural properties of real-world networks.
* The tables in ``../results.db`` are used to analyze results and generate all plots.
* ``master_plots.sh`` contains code for each plot included in the paper.
